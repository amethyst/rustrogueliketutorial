Web Assembly is a cool system that lets you run code compiled from non-web-based languages and run them in the browser. It comes with a few limitations:

* You are sandboxed, so you can't access much in the way of files on the user's computer.
* Threads work differently in WASM, so normal multi-threading code may not work without help.
* Your rendering back-end is going to be OpenGL, at least until WebGL is finished.
* I haven't written code to access files from the web, so you have to embed your resources. The tutorial chapters do this with the various `rltk::embedded_resource!` calls. At the very least, you need to use `include_bytes!` or similar to store the resource in the executable. (Or you can help me write a file reader!)

WASM is the tool used to make the playable chapter demos work in your browser.

## Building for the Web

The process for making a WASM version of your game is a little more involved than I'd like, but it works. I typically throw it into a batch file (or shell script) to automate the process.

### The Tools You Need

First of all, Rust needs to have the "target" installed to handle compilation to web assembly (WASM). The target name is `wasm32-unknown-unknown`. Assuming that you setup Rust with `rustup`, you can install it by typing:

```
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

You also need a tool called `wasm-bindgen`. This is a pretty impressive tool that can scan your web assembly and build the bits and pieces need to make the code run on the web. I use the command-line version (there are ways to integrate it into your system - hopefully that will be the topic of a future chapter). You can install the tool with:

```
cargo install wasm-bindgen-cli
```

*Note*: You'll have to reinstall `wasm-bindgen` when you update your Rust toolchain.

### Step 1: Compile the program for WASM

I recommend performing a `release` build for WASM. The debug versions can be *huge*, and nobody wants to wait while an enormous program downloads. Navigate to the root of your project, and type:

```
cargo build --release --target wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

The first time you do this, it will take *a while*. It has to recompile all the libraries you are using for web assembly! This creates files in the `target/wasm32-unknown-unknown/release/` folder. There will be several folders of build information and similar, and the important files: `yourproject.d` (debug information) and `yourproject.wasm` - the actual WASM target. (Replace `yourproject` with the name of your project)

### Step 2: Determine where to put the files

For the sake of simplicity, I'm going to use a target folder named `wasm`. You can use whatever you like, but you'll need to change the names in the rest of these instructions. Create the folder inside your root project folder. For example, `mkdir wasm`.

### Step 3: Assemble web files

Now you need to use `wasm-bindgen` to build the web infrastructure required to integrate with the browser.

```
wasm-bindgen target\wasm32-unknown-unknown\release\yourproject.wasm --out-dir wasm --no-modules --no-typescript
```

If you look inside the `wasm` folder, you will see two files:

* `yourproject.js` - JavaScript bindings for your project
* `yourproject_bg.wasm` - A modified version of the `wasm` output including the bindings required by the JavaScript file.

I typically rename these files to `myblob.js` and `myblob_bg.wasm`. You don't have to do that, but it lets me use the same template HTML each time.

### Step 4: Create some boilerplate HTML

In your `wasm` folder, you need to make an HTML page to host/launch your application. I use the same boilerplate each time:

```html
<html>
  <head>
    <meta content="text/html;charset=utf-8" http-equiv="Content-Type" />
  </head>
  <body>
    <canvas id="canvas" width="640" height="480"></canvas>
    <script src="./myblob.js"></script>
    <script>
      window.addEventListener("load", async () => {
        await wasm_bindgen("./myblob_bg.wasm");
      });
    </script>
  </body>
</html>
```

### Step 5: Host it!

You can't run WASM from a local file source (presumably for security reasons). You need to put it into a web server, and run it from there. If you have web hosting, copy your `wasm` folder to wherever you want it. You can then open the web server URL in a browser, and your game runs.

If you *don't* have web hosting, you need to install a local webserver, and serve it from there. (If you have Python installed you can run `python -m SimpleHTTPServer` from the `wasm` folder.)

## Help Wanted!

I'd love to integrate this into `cargo web` or similar, to provide a simple process for compiling and serving your games. I haven't made this work yet. If anyone would like to help, please head over to [My Github](https://github.com/thebracket/rustrogueliketutorial) and get in touch with me!
